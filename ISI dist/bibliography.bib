@article{Chhikara_1976,
	abstract = {In this paper we discuss testing hypotheses and interval estimation for the mean of the first passage time distribution in Brownian motion with positive drift (inverse Gaussian distribution). Optimum test procedures and confidence intervals for both one-sided and two-sided cases are derived in their exact forms, which utilize the percentage points of standard normal and Student's t distributions. In the case of an hypothesis with a two-sided alternative, it is shown that a uniformly most powerful (UMP) unbiased test is simply a two-tailed normal test if the nuisance parameter is known, and a two-tailed Student's t test if it is unknown.},

@article{Martingale,
	abstract = {Consider simple right censored survival data with a common unknown hazard rate. The hazard rate is here modelled nonparametrically, as a jump process having a martingale structure with respect to the prior distribution. For an evaluation of posterior probabilities, given the data, sample paths of the hazard rate are generated from the posterior distribution by using a dynamic version of the Gibbs sampler. The algorithm is described in detail. It is also shown how, by slightly modifying the algorithm, the procedure can be altered to correspond to a constrained estimation problem where the hazard rate is known to be increasing (or decreasing). The methods are illustrated by simulation examples.},
